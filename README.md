# CSS Media Queries Lab

## Summary

Starting from an unresponsive CSS layout of Steve's profile only CSS media queries were used to make the website responsive at all screen widths and devices. Samsung galaxy s5 was used as a reference phone device to see how the website would change in a mobile device. None of the HTML and CSS code outside the media query were touched


## Bonus Tasks

 1. Have two breakpoints, giving a mobile, tablet and desktop view
 2. CSS was simplified as much as possible
